            <b>Portrait Photography</b> <br>
            <dl>
                One of the most common photography styles, 
                portrait photography, or portraiture, aims to capture the personality and mood of an individual or group
            </dl>
            <b>Fashion Photography</b> <br>
            <dl>
                ashion photography showcases and glamorizes fashion 
                clothing, shoes, and accessories to make them more desirable to consumers. It is 
                commonly published in magazines and online. People may choose this niche over different 
                types of photography because of the opportunity to be highly creative in making photographs
                 eye-catching and appealing. Fashion photographers take a lot of full body shots and work in an 
                 array of locations, from fashion shows to studios with full lighting setups to city streets and 
                 open fields
            </dl>
            <b>Sports Photography</b> <br>
            <dl>
                By catching athletes, coaches, and even fans at the perfect moment, sports 
                photographs can depict the passion, drama, and emotion that fuels sporting events.
                 Sports photographers must aim and shoot quickly to keep up with the action around them,
                  and it’s best practice to use a higher ISO to shoot at a faster shutter speed. Sports 
                  photographers also usually use long, heavy lenses for zooming in on the action. Interesting 
                  angles can help make your work stand out in this competitive genre.
            </dl>
            <b>Editorial Photography</b> <br>
            <dl>
                Editorial photography is taken to illustrate a story or article, typically for a 
                magazine or newspaper. The subject of editorial photography can vary widely and is
                 entirely dependent on the topic of the text it accompanies. Generally, for editorial 
                 photography, you’ll want to get shots that work for a variety of layouts, including 
                 horizontal and vertical compositions. When working in editorial photography, you are likely
                  to work closely with writers and art directors, and demonstrating good communication
                   skills and professionalism will help you succeed
            </dl>
            <b>Architectural Photography</b> <br>
            <dl>
                Both the interior and exterior design of buildings and structures are the subject of architectural 
                photography. From warehouses to city bridges to old country barns, this genre encompasses diverse 
                structures. Often, the photograph showcases the structure’s most aesthetically pleasing parts, 
                such as a particular beam or archway. Interesting materials and colors may also be emphasized. 
                Lighting can be challenging in architectural photography and, for exteriors, photographers must 
                know how to work with natural light. Gear such as a tilt-shift lens, a tripod, and a panorama head 
                is often useful. Architectural photographs can be of value to designers, architects, leasing companies,
                 and building investors.
